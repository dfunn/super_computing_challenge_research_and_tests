All the info inside here will be given for my teamates to read, edit, and share many of the file and directories.

## About our project

Originally based on Robotic ML and networking, using cameras to detect lethal weapons in the pressence of the building. Has now been scratched solely because the other team from our school has identical purposes and use of ML in robots. We hadn't talked which a complete bummer.

However, we have gotten up and had changed courses to be only networking based cyber-security. Though we don't know what exactly we will achieve we will find more info about networking as a whole.

We will be using the Python programming language for this project.

_Possible change to this section will be possible in the future._
